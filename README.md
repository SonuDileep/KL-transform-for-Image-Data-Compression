# KL-transform-for-Image-Data-Compression
This is a python implementation of Karhunen-Loeve (KL) mapping technique for image/data compression. 
KL is an optimal dimensionality reduction mapping technique and is based on finding the best orthonormal basis.
The goal of this technique is to find the subspace where most of the data lies. Check out this link for a deeper 
understanding of KL algorithm, http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e161/lectures/klt/node3.html.
